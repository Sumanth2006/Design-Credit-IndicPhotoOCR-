📌 Scene Text Data Collection & Evaluation Using IndicPhotoOCR

This project focuses on collecting images, writing text annotations, and using the existing IndicPhotoOCR system to understand how OCR works on real-world scene-text images.

We did not build any model.
We only used IndicPhotoOCR to test how well it reads text from our collected images.

⭐ What We Did

Collected real-world images containing Indian-language text

Wrote the correct text manually for each image

Used the existing IndicPhotoOCR toolkit to compare OCR output with our annotations

Observed where the OCR system works well and where it struggles

Learned how a simple ML pipeline works through a hands-on activity

⭐ Key Learnings

Basics of data collection

Importance of clean annotations

How OCR behaves on different types of images

Practical challenges in scene-text understanding
